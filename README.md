Tkapp
Tkapp is for the refined programmer. A good cup of tea requires a cup, water, a pot, and tea. Tkapp is like the pot that boils up hot water to get you started.

Features
-SQLite Database Boilerplate.
-Encrypted Login Manager.
-Iterative Design and Widget Attachment.
-Simple to use Gui and Readable Design Code.


Motivation
  Tkapp is my attempt at speeding up desktop application production. Traditional approaches require complex planning and remembering where everything fits in, even with the best diagram and design notes. Putting everything together can be hard. Not so with a simple GUI. That appends boilerplate code to an application .py file.
