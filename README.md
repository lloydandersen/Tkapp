# Tkapp

## About
Tkapp is for the refined programmer. A good cup of tea requires a cup, water, a pot, and tea. Tkapp is like the pot that boils up hot water to get you started.

## Features
- SQLite Database Boilerplate.
- Encrypted Login Manager.
- Iterative Design and Widget Attachment.
- Simple to use Gui and Readable Design Code.


## Motivation
  Tkapp is my attempt at speeding up desktop application production. Traditional approaches require complex planning and remembering where everything fits in, even with the best diagram and design notes. Putting everything together can be hard. Not so with a simple GUI. That appends boilerplate code to an application .py file.

## How to Install
  Tkapp has been converted into an executable file. Just download the newest and most stable version from GitHub versions. Make sure to add the Tkapp Icon to your desktop homepage for quick access.



## How to Use
  Tkapp is extremely simple to use. It is easy to make a mistake which can be difficult to fix within the Gui. So rather than continue on after making a signfigant mistake(new page, new frame). I recommend just starting over again. Which even if annoying will be at least 10x faster than coding everything out.
